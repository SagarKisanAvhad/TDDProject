# TDDProject

This Project is a sample project of Test Driven Developement approach in Android.
We can use this approach for following:
1) adding new feature in app
2) bug fixing in app
3) refactoring in app

I have learnt TDD from [Mindorks Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.mindorks.com/) and [Raywenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/7109-test-driven-development-tutorial-for-android-getting-started) websites.
